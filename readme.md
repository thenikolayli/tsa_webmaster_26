# Event Theme
Create a website that will serve as a community resource hub to highlight resources available to residents within the community (e.g., non-profits, support services, community events and programs, etc.). Your website should include the following: 
- an interactive directory of community resources (resource hub) that allows users to search and filter the resources. 
- a highlight section that spotlights at least three of the community resources you have listed in your resource hub. 
- a form that users can submit to indicate new resources that should be added to the community resources hub. 
- additional content to enhance the community resource hub for end users.

# Instructions
NEVER push to main!! Instead, create a branch and push to the branch and create a pull request.

# Features
- FastAPI CRUD API - Create, Read, Update, Destroy API for interacting with the database for interacting with the community resources.
- SvelteKit frontend - Frontend.
- SQLite3 DB - Database to save community resources and user info.
- User functionality so admins can create new resources based on the form.

# Ideas
- Google Maps to show community resource locations.
