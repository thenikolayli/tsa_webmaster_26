# Event Theme
Create a website that will serve as a community resource hub to highlight resources available to residents within the community (e.g., non-profits, support services, community events and programs, etc.). Your website should include the following: 
- an interactive directory of community resources (resource hub) that allows users to search and filter the resources. 
- a highlight section that spotlights at least three of the community resources you have listed in your resource hub. 
- a form that users can submit to indicate new resources that should be added to the community resources hub. 
- additional content to enhance the community resource hub for end users.
Yo, Nikolay, you’re not even a threat,
I’m the nightmare that you wish you could forget,
You’re a clown in my circus, just a joke on display,
You stepped in my lane? Now you’re feelin’ the sway.

Your bars are trash, I’m shovin’ 'em in the trash,
You’re a lightweight, better step back or crash,
I’m the king in this game, you’re just a peasant,
Your whole existence? Nah, it’s irrelevant.

You’re tryna be a boss but can’t even afford the title,
I’m the fire, you’re the spark that went out—vital,
You think you’re a king, but I’m slayin’ your pride,
Your whole career’s a lie, better run, better hide.

Nikolay Li, you’re a footnote in my book,
Lookin’ like a fool, now you’re beggin’ for a look,
I’m burnin’ your name, got your face in the dirt,
You’re just a casualty in my lyrical shirt.

Who the hell you foolin', you ain't built like me,
Your bars weak as hell, man, I spit with the sea,
I’ll drown your career with every word I say,
By the time I’m done, you won’t even see the day.

I’m a titan, you a toddler, get out the way,
You should quit rap and go dig graves,
Your flow’s so dead, it’s rotting in the dirt,
Every rhyme you spit just makes my stomach hurt.

I’m slappin' your face with these bars, real vicious,
Your whole style’s fake, dog, it’s straight-up fictitious,
Nikolay, you’re soft, I’m just breakin’ the truth,
I’m the bullet, you’re the target—‘bout to leave you with proof.

Nikolay Li, you’re a footnote in my book,
Lookin’ like a fool, now you’re beggin’ for a look,
I’m burnin’ your name, got your face in the dirt,
You’re just a casualty in my lyrical shirt.

Man, you ain’t even on my level, so step back,
I’m a beast with a pen, and you’re just a hack,
I’m movin’ like a lion, you a scared little cat,
I’m makin’ moves while you still stuck in the past.

Your time’s up, Nikolay, it’s game over, son,
I’ve already won, now go cry to your mom,
I’m the storm, you’re just the rain, it’s plain,
Now bow down, ‘cause I just wrecked your name.
